          one of the things that the community was very happy we were doing was
          not only because of the food they got, but because we were able to
          customisation the kind of food we gave to pregnant women, small
          children, because we had the data. Where we did not have the data we
          gave people the standard ration. So I think knowing who are in the
          city what they eat for eg: even regular ration also were customised.
          People from Orissa and Bengal we gave certain kind of rice and Dal;
          people from North Karnataka we gave different food and then for people
          from Rajasthan we gave wheat flour - and people from South we gave a
          different kind of rice and Dal - we were able to customise to that
          extent because we knew the population rate.

          Townhall is a place where you go to dissent - I am one of these people
          who are quite regular in a lot of these street demonstrations so I am
          usually there so if there is a call for public demonstration by civil
          society, or else there is a place called Freedom Park which is also
          designated space for dissent.

              minorities and sex workers and we approached some other funders
              also. We constantly provided three months dry ration kit to across
              Karnataka, to around 7000 people - female sex workers and sexual
              minorities are our beneficiaries.

              We worked with around 12,000 families of waste pickers - we gave
              ration for two months, and after that citizens approached us and
              asked us to help -approximately 50,000 families got rations for
              one or two months. Then we specifically worked with identifying
              people who have comorbidity who are on regular medication for
              pregnant women or children so we serviced them also. We knew this
              will happen so we started much early. In fact when they announced
              the lock down, that particular evening I think we had already
              supported 3500 families.

          The challenges were the difficulties faced in mobility due to the
          lockdown - there used to be some official vehicles and sometimes even
          people holding valid passes - BBMP issues certificates but the police
          won’t always accept it as the police also issues certificates and the
          police doesn’t issue certificates to everyone so you know there was a
          command failure at the government level at the administration level
          with regards to the validity of the certificates.

          The MOHFW publish only today’s real time data, they don’t publish any
          archives of old data, so it was important for us to collect it every
          day - so that kind of put pressure that every day, at least initially,
          we had to keep looking at it to keep the data updated otherwise you
          would lose it - and the relevance of the data will also go away if you
          don't update it. That was stressful and of course, there is always
          some issue with data, right, they miss a zero at the end and things
          like that, so you had to manually check everyday.

          You have a lot of big tech companies sort of substituting roles, so
          online education became this huge thing, where, because of the shift
          that happened overnight because the circumstances demanded it -- you
          suddenly have this situation where it became so much easier for
          Microsoft and Google and Byjus and all of these outfits to start
          pushing that, and these have long term impacts - the problem is not
          online education certainly, (I’m not an anti technologist) it’s about
          the fact that you end up privatising these solutions

          I think looking at contact tracing for example or other kinds of like
          health data management these that was a learning was immense right
          like what was happening tells us more what should we really be looking
          for in terms of example if we look at a very simple thing like contact
          tracing, now all of these are technically in violation of many state
          laws like you know they do threaten privacy they do tend to have an
          overreach on citizen rights in many ways but most governments do have
          these laws that are about extraordinary times and pandemics are
          extraordinary times when they can take these measures and do these
          things. so that’s kind of an allowed thing it’s not like there’s
          anything wrong with that of course the way that it pans out is very
          problematic but one thing that you know a lot of people have been
          worrying about is that it’s very likely that the shifts that we see
          right exponential growth towards e-commerce like this you know
          interesting normalisation of surveillance all of these things are you
          know in roads to very long time shifts that we should be very careful
          about that how they pan out.
